### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mitch!

About me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at AI Camp. I've developed lots for them ranging from a [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/ai-on-thumbs/id1577852073), writing  curricula for NLP (GPT-2/Flask/Bootstrap/aitextgen/DiscordAPI)/CV (YOLOv5/Flask/Bootstrap)/Data Science (SK-Learn/Tensorflow/Flask/Bootstrap)/GANS(StyleGANv2/Flask/Bootstrap/DiscordAPI), and building projects with students involving reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, and games.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning django and flask, and a whole lot about NLP.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on products strictly built for fun -- looking for more hobby work. Very interested in working with DALL-E-2 products once I can get my hands on the code as well.
